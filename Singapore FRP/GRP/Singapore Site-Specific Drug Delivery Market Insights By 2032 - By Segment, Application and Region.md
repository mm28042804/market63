<strong>Site-Specific Drug Delivery Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

The selective delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to their site of action should increase therapeutic effectiveness and limit side effects. Most drug therapies currently available,   however, exhibit little, if any specificity. Many times, a drug has limited or no access to its intended site of action or is prematurely metabolized or excreted. In other instances, the drug travels rather freely throughout the body and not only acts on the desired target tissues but also causes undesirable effects on nontarget tissues. This lack of target specificity is attributable, for the most part, to the formidable barriers that the body presents to the successful delivery of a drug from its site of administration to its site of action: a drug normally encounters or must by pass various molecules, enzymes, cells, membranes, and organs before reaching its designated target.
