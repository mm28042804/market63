# Singapore Bluetooth Beacon Device Market Size, Growth - Latest Insights Published

<strong>Bluetooth Beacon Device Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

A beacon is a small Bluetooth radio transmitter. It's kind of like a lighthouse: it repeatedly transmits a single signal that other devices can see. Instead of emitting visible light, though, it broadcasts a radio signal that is made up of a combination of letters and numbers transmitted on a regular interval of approximately 1/10th of a second. A Bluetooth-equipped device like a smartphone can ""see"" a beacon once it's in range, much like sailors looking for a lighthouse to know where they are.
